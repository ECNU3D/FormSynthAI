## Quick Start Demo

A small demo script is provided to showcase synthetic form generation using the `formsynth` package.

1. Create a blank form template in the `examples` directory:

```bash
python examples/create_blank_form.py
```

2. Generate a filled form based on `sample_config.json`:

```bash
python -m formsynth.generator examples/sample_config.json output.png
```

Add `--handwritten` to apply a handwriting-style effect and `--font` to supply a custom TrueType font.
