Thanks for the details. I’ll now search for commercial and open-source solutions that support uploading scanned or digital forms, identifying editable fields, applying rule-based synthetic data generation (including handwriting simulation), and generating synthetic filled forms. I’ll prioritize those offering API/SDK integration and on-premises deployment options.

I’ll get back to you shortly with a structured comparison or a BRD draft if no suitable solutions exist.


# Solutions for Synthetic Form Field Detection and Filling

## Overview of the Use Case

Producing **synthetic, filled-out forms** requires multiple capabilities: identifying blank fields on form templates, generating fake data with custom formats, rendering that data in both typed and handwritten styles, and then **merging it back** into the original form image/PDF. This is a complex pipeline, but there are both end-to-end products and combinations of tools that address these needs. Below we outline complete solutions (commercial and open-source) as well as partial components that can be integrated to meet all requirements.

## End-to-End Solutions (Commercial)

* **SymageDocs (Symage)** – A commercial platform specializing in high-fidelity synthetic documents and forms. SymageDocs can replicate real form layouts (including checkboxes, tables, etc.) and fill them with **synthetic data**. It supports *dynamic handwriting* (realistic cursive and printed handwriting simulation) as well as typed text in various fonts and styles. The generated forms closely mimic real scans, with configurable variations (handwritten vs. typed content, noise, etc.) for realism. Symage provides field-level annotations and labels for each generated form (useful if training AI models). *Integration:* SymageDocs is delivered as a service (no public SDK docs); however, it emphasizes privacy (no real PII) and can likely be deployed or used in on-premises scenarios by delivering synthetic datasets. (It’s advisable to contact Symage for API/SDK details.)

* **GenRocket Synthetic Data Platform** – A commercial **test data generation** solution that includes synthetic form generation. GenRocket allows users to model a form template (e.g. an image or PDF of a blank form) and define rules for each field’s dummy data. It can then automatically **merge** the template with the generated values to output filled forms. GenRocket supports both typed text and simulating handwriting *difficult to read handwriting are all easy to simulate* – users can introduce variation in ink color, slant, or even add noise/blur to mimic real handwriting. For typed fields, you can specify fonts, sizes, etc. Under the hood, GenRocket can integrate with PDF generation APIs or image templates: *it reads a JSON template, calls a tool (e.g. PDF Generator API) to create a PDF, and then merges the PDF template with synthetically generated data*. The platform provides **APIs (REST, JDBC, etc.)** for integration, and it supports hybrid on-prem deployment – form designs can be done in their cloud interface, but **all data generation runs on-premises** in your environment. This ensures sensitive info never leaves your site. GenRocket’s strength is the fine-grained control: you can define field formats (dates, names, numeric patterns, etc.) and even map X/Y coordinates of fields on the form for precise placement.

## Notable Partial Solutions (Open-Source and SDKs)

If no single product fits all needs, you can integrate several tools to achieve the pipeline:

* **Field Detection & Template Parsing:** To identify and classify blank fields on a form, one approach is using OCR and layout analysis. For example, **OpenCV** (for image processing) combined with an OCR engine (like Tesseract) can detect printed text labels and drawing elements. This can help locate form fields by finding rectangles or lines where input is expected. Another option is using pre-trained form-parsing AI: e.g. **Microsoft Azure Form Recognizer** or **AWS Textract**, which can detect key-value pairs in forms. These cloud APIs will return form field labels and values – if a field is blank, they may return the label with no value, effectively identifying an empty field. (Azure’s Form Recognizer can be deployed via container for on-prem use, and offers a customizable model to learn your specific form layout.) **ABBYY FlexiCapture** (commercial, on-prem) is another SDK that lets you define form templates and can locate fields by their coordinates or OCR’d labels. These detection tools typically allow a *user-defined configuration* or training step – for example, labeling example forms so the system learns to find “Name”, “Address” fields, etc., which meets the *user-editable configuration* requirement.

* **Custom Synthetic Data Generators:** For populating each field with fake but realistic content, you can use general-purpose data generation libraries. **Faker** (open-source in many languages) lets you generate names, addresses, dates, IDs, etc., in configurable formats. You can script rules (e.g. date of birth between 1970–2000, phone number in `(XXX) XXX-XXXX` format, text in different languages, etc.). Commercial synthetic data tools like **Tonic.ai** or **Mostly AI** focus on databases, but could generate structured data to feed into form fields as well. These handle the *language, style, formatting rules* per field (for example, ensuring a ZIP code is 5 digits). In an end-to-end solution like GenRocket, this capability is built-in; with open-source, you’d combine Faker or similar libraries to produce a dictionary of field values according to your rules.

* **Digital Text Rendering (Typed Fields):** Once you have field positions and synthetic values, the next step is merging them into the form. For **digital-style text**, this can be done by programmatically drawing text onto the form image or PDF. Libraries like **Pillow/PIL** or **OpenCV** can place text at specific X,Y coordinates on an image, using any font and size you choose. This allows using fonts that mimic typed text or even computer-generated handwriting fonts. If the original form is a PDF with fillable form fields (AcroForm), you can also use PDF utilities (such as **iText**, **PDFBox**, or **pdfrw**) to fill those fields and then flatten the PDF. These methods support on-prem integration (pure libraries). An open-source example is Microsoft’s **Genalog** toolkit, which generates whole documents from templates – you define an HTML/CSS template for a form and Genalog renders it with specified fonts, sizes, alignment, etc., to produce a synthetic document image. This covers the *configurable font and formatting* aspect for digital text. (Genalog also can add realistic noise – blur, distortion, “scanning” artifacts – to simulate a scanned form.)

* **Handwriting Synthesis:** Generating *handwritten* field values is more challenging, but there are solutions. **Handwriting.io** is an API that takes input text and returns an image of that text in a chosen handwriting style (it offers multiple realistic handwriting “fonts” not just off-the-shelf fonts). This API (and similar services like *Skribbl* or *Calligrapher.ai*) can produce cursive or print writing with variation in stroke, which you could then overlay onto your form. For an open-source approach, researchers have developed deep learning models to generate human-like handwriting. For example, an implementation of Alex Graves’ neural network model can **produce cursive handwriting given arbitrary text**. Such models output sequences of pen strokes, allowing synthetic writing that includes natural variability and even *injectable “messiness”* (like jitter, inconsistent letter shapes, or occasional illegible squiggles to mimic human errors). In practice, a simpler route is to use a variety of handwriting-style TrueType fonts combined with random distortions. Open-source tools like **TRDG (Text Recognition Data Generator)** or **PytorchOCR** allow rendering text with different fonts and adding noise/blur; by plugging in a collection of handwriting fonts and slight random transformations (slant, spacing, wiggle), you can approximate handwriting and introduce ambiguities. These generated text images (for each field) are then merged onto the form template.

* **Merging and Output:** After generating either digital text or a handwriting image for a field, you **overlay** it onto the form. For images, this can be done by compositing with Pillow or OpenCV (taking care to match the perspective or angle if the form is scanned at an angle). For PDFs, one can place the text in the PDF and flatten it. The result is a filled-out form that looks authentic. To automate this, one could create a script or pipeline that takes a form template plus a config of field coordinates, then for each synthetic data record: generate field values (Faker/etc.), render each as either text or handwriting image, and draw them onto the template. Tools like GenRocket essentially perform this pipeline internally, but it can be replicated with open components as described.

**Table Legend:** *“Yes” indicates direct support; “Possible” indicates support with additional integration or configuration.* The **end-to-end commercial solutions** (SymageDocs, GenRocket) cover all stages out-of-the-box. In contrast, **partial solutions** require combining multiple tools – for instance, using Azure Form Recognizer or an OCR method for field detection, then custom generation of data and writing it to the form with scripting.

Both approaches can fulfill the requirements. If an off-the-shelf product is preferred and budget allows, SymageDocs or GenRocket would provide a unified solution (SymageDocs focusing on highly realistic document outputs, and GenRocket offering a robust platform with integration hooks). If more control or a free solution is desired, an open-source pipeline can be developed using the components above, albeit with more engineering effort. Each method supports API/SDK integration and on-premises use: the commercial tools have enterprise deployment options, while the open-source approach runs in your local environment by design.
